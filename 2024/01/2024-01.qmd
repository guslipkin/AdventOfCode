```{r}
#| message: false
library(mistlecode)

options(scipen = 999)
```

```{r}
dt <- 
  readr::read_delim('input.txt', delim = '   ', col_names = FALSE)
```

## Part 1

This was nice and quick. I'm pretty happy with my global rank 518.

```{r}
dt1 <- dt$X1 |> sort()
dt2 <- dt$X2 |> sort()

abs(dt1 - dt2) |> sum()
```

## Part 2

This took way too long for me. I was really struggling with the counting portion for some reason and it took a long time for me to internalize that `x %in% y` and `which` don't actually count things. Might need to add that to `mistlecode`...

```{r}
dt |>
  dplyr::mutate('count' = purrr::map_int(.data$X1, \(x) {
    which(.data$X2 == x) |> length()
  })) |>
  dplyr::mutate('count' = .data$X1 * .data$count) |>
  dplyr::pull(.data$count) |>
  sum()
```
