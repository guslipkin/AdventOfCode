All of my solutions are in R with varying degrees of complexity and documentation.\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n\n## Under Construction\n\nI'm currently trying to convert this from a Quarto Book to a Quarto Blog. There ended up being too much for the Book format to handle so I'm hoping a Blog is easier to maintain.\n\n:::\n\n## [CLICK HERE FOR MY SOLUTIONS](solutions.html)\n\n## Star Chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](stars.png)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## My Favorite Solutions\n\n- [2016-12](2016/12/2016-12.html) and [2017-08](2017/08/2017-08.html): I [created a small assembly style computer](https://mistlecode.guslipkin.me/reference/assembly) that solves the problems for me given a set of registers and instructions.\n- [2021-09](2021/09/2021-09.html): I used the `dbscan` clustering method to solve a path finding issue. \n- [2022-04](2022/04/2022-04.html): While not my fastest part 1, part 2 took me just 38 seconds!\n- [2022-11](2022/11/2022-11.html): I used [S3 Classes](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html#s3) and [function factories](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html?q=function%20fac#function-factories) for the first time, and got just a little bit better at recursion.\n",
