```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(mistlecode)
```

## Part 1

Easy enough. I wanted to do it in one pipe-line, but couldn't think of anything efficient enough.

```{r}
"input.txt" |>
  readLines() |>
  map_lgl(\(x) {
    x <-
      x |>
      str_split_1(" ") |>
      table()
    all(x == 1)
  }) |>
  sum()
```

## Part 2

I thought this would be harder, but then I realized I can just sort each string then use table again.

```{r}
"input.txt" |>
  readLines() |>
  map_lgl(\(x) {
    x <-
      x |>
      str_split_1(" ") |>
      map_chr(\(y) {
        y |>
          str_split_1("") |>
          sort() |>
          paste0(collapse = "")
      }) |>
      table()
    all(x == 1)
  }) |>
  sum()
```
