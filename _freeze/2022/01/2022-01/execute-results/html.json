I knew from the get-go that I would need to use the global assignment operator inside the loop. For reasons I thought that naming my variable `sum` would work but got an error since that's a reserved word in R (duh!). Find+replace helped get that sorted but my inner loop logic was still wrong. I realized that I was missing an `else` case to catch any time the maximum hadn't changed, but the sum needed to be reset.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='2022-01_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_999279475ce77cd78edca109404d172a'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsm <- 0\nmaxsm <- 0\nfor (x in dt) {\n  x <- as.numeric(x)\n  if (!is.na(x)) {\n    sm <<- sm + x\n  }\n  else if (sm > maxsm) {\n      maxsm <<- sm\n      sm <<- 0\n  }\n  else {\n    sm <<- 0\n  }\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Part 2\n\nComing out of Part 1 was really strong, especially on Day 1. Instead of saving just the max sum, I made it a vector to record all sums. Then I just need to sort it, get the top three values, and sum those.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='2022-01_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_922ae33a3e5921f6742a226808e6ffb9'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsm <- 0\nmaxsm <- c()\nfor (x in dt) {\n  x <- as.numeric(x)\n  if (!is.na(x)) {\n    sm <<- sm + x\n  }\n  else  {\n      maxsm <<- c(maxsm, sm)\n      sm <<- 0\n  }\n}\nsum(sort(maxsm, decreasing = TRUE)[1:3])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 200044\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
